# Airbnb-Dashboard-
Developed a fully functional Airbnb Dashboard using Tableau Public, analyzing a comprehensive dataset of Airbnb listings.

The dashboard features interactive visualizations, including a map highlighting price distribution by zip code, bar charts showing average price per bedroom, line graphs tracking revenue trends over time, and a distinct count of reviews per month. By integrating filters and calculated fields, the dashboard provides actionable insights into geographic pricing patterns, seasonal trends, and market competition, aiding in informed investment decisions for property listings.
